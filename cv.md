# About Myself

Iâ€™m currently working several small web projects (example:[Roads project](https://html-css-flexbox-backroads-new-design.netlify.com/)).My goal is to learn everything new and exciting. I love to code and watching movies. I love to spend my spare time doing what interests me. My strengths are in problem solving, communication and fast learning. I want to get knowledge and skills that will be useful for employment in a company. I started learning the basics of front-end development in 2022 and have already built several small-sized projects using HTML and CSS. I believe I can learn how to use the latest technologies in the industry and become a professional web developer
